# UsingPublicAPI
Using a public api to extract information (interview practice)

# What I learned:
1) Request data from public api using http request (Get)
2) Fetching Data as a string
3) Mapping data into a data object  
### Note: Didnt add try catch block, you should in production code
going to use linq to sort data
